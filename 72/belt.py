#         Complete the get_belt function below which receives a user_score which you can assume to be an int.

#         The function should return the corresponding belt name from the HONORS dict. For example with 162 points you would have the orange belt (not yet reached green), 401 = brown, 999 is paneled, etc.

#         Note that the scores are inclusive so if you have 10 points you have earned the white belt, â‰¥ 50 = yellow belt, etc. Also make sure you take the min and max boundaries into account (< 10 is no belt and > 1000 is the highest belt).
