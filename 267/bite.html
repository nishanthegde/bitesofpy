<p>In this algorithm Bite, the challenge is to measure the size of an island in the ocean, based on the 2D map that you have been provided.</p>
<p>In this map, 0 represents <i>ocean</i> and 1 <i>land</i>.</p>
<p>You can assume there is only one island on the map, you need to measure its size (or <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/perimeter.html" target="_blank">parameter</a>).</p>
<p>The matrix cells are connected horizontally and vertically, not diagonally.</p>
<p>Here is an example:<br>

<p>Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!<p>
